/**
 * StreamdownRN - Streaming Markdown Renderer for React Native
 *
 * High-performance streaming markdown renderer optimized for AI responses.
 * Uses block-level stability to minimize re-renders during streaming.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Completed blocks are memoized and NEVER re-render
 * - Only the active (currently streaming) block re-renders on new tokens
 * - Block boundaries are detected incrementally
